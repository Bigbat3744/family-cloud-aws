# Day 6 – Making Terraform and AWS Shake Hands

Today was all about alignment — getting Terraform and AWS to agree on what actually exists. It felt less chaotic than yesterday, but still required patience and a lot of back‑and‑forth between the console and my `.tf` files.

---

### What I Tried
- Matched my Lambda configuration with Terraform (runtime, handler, role, env vars)  
- Cleaned up the CloudFront block to reflect the real distribution  
- Started documenting every AWS setting so Terraform can mirror it  
- Re‑ran `terraform plan` after each adjustment  

---

### What Went Wrong
- Terraform kept trying to “fix” AWS because my code was still incomplete  
- Missing fields caused Terraform to plan destructive changes  
- Cognito needed a full configuration block, not just a name  
- CloudFront’s modern policies didn’t match Terraform’s older required fields  

---

### How I Fixed It
- Pulled exact values from AWS Console and added them to Terraform  
- Used AWS’s Managed Cache Policy IDs instead of guessing  
- Added the required Terraform fields even when AWS didn’t show them  
- Repeated the cycle: update code → run plan → compare → adjust  
- Slowly reduced the number of changes Terraform wanted to make  

---

### What I Learned
- Terraform migration is a marathon, not a sprint  
- The goal is to make Terraform say: **“No changes”**  
- AWS Console and Terraform speak different dialects — you have to translate  
- Once everything matches, CI/CD becomes effortless
